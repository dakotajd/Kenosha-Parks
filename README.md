# Kenosha Parks
> This app was developed as a UW-Parkside App Factory project for the Kenosha County parks organization for them to use as a way to manage events at different parks throughout any given year. The app consumes a REST API (also developed by the App Factory) that assists with keeping track of events for each park. The code in this repository is just a sample. The app will not compile because certain parts have been removed by request of the App Factory. This app was developed with a team of 3 other App Factory members/students.

The app uses the following technologies/libraries/patterns:

* Android Build Flavors (the other flavors for this project are not in this repository)
* Google Maps
* Retrofit
* OKHTTP 3
* GSON
* MVVM Architecture
